# ItemEconomy
This is an addon for the SimplePets v5 plugin.

It allows players to purchase pets by using In-Game Items configured in its config 
The items used as currency can be Custom Models you just need to know what material the item is and what the CustomModelData number is

- [Custom Items](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/63848/) Plugin
- [ItemsAdder](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/73355/) Plugin

# Here I will explain what each value controls for all the pet type customization.
# - 'enabled'
#    This will allow you to toggle if the pet is FREE or if they have to pay
# - 'display'
#    This is what will be displayed as the 'price' of the item
#    This is customizable so you should be able to use Custom Items (Custom Model Data Items)
# 
#    Note: Colors can be used here ;)
# - 'material'
#    This is what controls what material the players have to pay with
#    If you are using CustomModels this will have to be the base item for the item
# 
#    See: https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/bukkit/browse/src/main/java/org/bukkit/Material.java#123
# - 'count'
#    This one is self explanatory how many of said item will the player pay with
# - 'custom-model-data'
#    If you have a resource pack that adds custom models chances are you use CustomModels
#    This allows you to specify what model of item you are using
#    (This is how other plugins such as ItemsAdder have support)
# 
#    Note: If you are not using Custom Models then set the value to -1
#    See:  https://mcmodels.net/how-to-tutorials/resource-pack-tutorials/what-is-custommodeldata-2/
